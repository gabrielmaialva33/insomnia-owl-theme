### [Insomnia](http://insomnia.rest)

- Open **Preferences > Plugins**, search for `insomnia-plugin-theme-omni-owl` and click **Install Plugin**;
- After that, go to **Themes** (also under preferences) and apply the **Omni Owl** theme.

#### Troubleshooting

- **Package not found**: If the installation fails because of an error saying it did not find the package, it may be because of a bug that happens when installing Insomnia on Linux with [Snap](https://snapcraft.io/). To fix it, take a look [at this comment](https://github.com/getomni/insomnia/issues/6#issuecomment-781633104).
